            publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. NetManga may, 
            however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole 
            judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service 
            you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate,
            offensive, indecent, or objectionable. NetManga does not endorse any User Content or any opinion, 
            recommendation, or advice expressed in any User Content. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or

            Content allegedly does not confirm to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion
            whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For 
            clarity, NetManga does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.

        <h1>Payment Terms</h1>
        <p>
        </br></br>
            Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, 
            you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in Euro and are non-refundable.
        </br></br>
            1. Pricing: NetManga reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. NetManga will make reasonable efforts 
            to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for 
            current pricing information. 
            NetManga may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if NetManga gives you 
            advance notice of changes before they apply. NetManga, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different 
            features and different 
            pricing to any of NetManga’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.
        </br></br>
            2. Authorization: NetManga will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. 
            You authorize NetManga to charge to that payment method all sums for orders that you make and any level of Service 
            you select as described in these Terms or 
            published by the Company. If you pay any fees with a credit card, NetManga may seek pre-authorization of your 
            credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit 
            available to cover your purchase. 
            Payment processing services are provided by the third-party service through which the purchase is made.
        </br></br>
            3. Subscriptions and Auto-Renewals: The Service may allow you to subscribe to a plan (“Subscription Plan”) for 
            which you will be periodically billed the amounts indicated to you at the time of your subscription, as may be 
            updated from time to time by NetManga, on a 
            forward-going basis, upon notice to you (the “Subscription Fee”). When you subscribe to a Subscription Plan, the
            Subscription Plan will be billed on a periodic basis. You hereby authorize NetManga to charge you on a going-forward 
            basis and until cancellation of either 
            the Subscription Plan or your account. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the day of the month when you sign up to your 
            Subscription Plan. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes 
            for the next subscription period.
        </br></br>
            BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR SUCCESSIVE PERIODS UNLESS 
            YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR ACCOUNT AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.
        </br></br>
            B) Refunds; Cancellation. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PLAN AT ANY TIME, IN WHICH CASE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL EXPIRE 
            AT THE END OF THAT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD (AND UPON WHICH EXPIRATION YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL NO LONGER BE RENEWED OR CHARGED). 
            You must cancel your 
            Subscription Plan before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We 
            will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different 
            payment method if you change 
            your payment information)
        </br></br>
            4. Unpaid accounts: NetManga may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, 
            for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account 
            will be charged with fees 
            or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees.
        </p>
        <h1>Suspension of Access</h1>
        <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue access to certain User Content in the event of a rights issue or other business or legal issue.</p>
        <h1>Termination</h1>
        <p>
            The Agreement is the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Service and/or User Content, and 
            supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter. If any term or condition of this Agreement is 
            deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that part will be deemed 
            severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term or condition.
        </p>
        <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
        <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
        <h1>Governing Law</h1>
        <p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
        <h1>Disputes Resolution</h1>

        <h2>Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
